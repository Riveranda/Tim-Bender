### Current Projects :hammer_and_wrench:

<p align="center"><b>Catscript</b> an original object oriented language whose compliler is written in Java.<br> In addition to this, I am activitely building and developing a robotic buggie powered by a raspberry pi and driven by Opencv. This robitic buggie will be driven by an android application leveraging Kotlin's server sockets.<br> My final, now completed project is an implementation of python's NEAT neural network library to solve simple games such as flappy bird. I will hopefully be crushing the classic game, Snake, with deeplearning soon. </p>
