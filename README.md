### Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

<p align="left">My name is <b>Timothy Bender</b>, I am an Android developer and a Senior at Montana State studying Computer Science. I am currently working at Spudnik Llc as a Software Engineering Intern. You can reach me at tbenderfcs@gmail.com.</p>

<p align="left">I have been passionate about programming since I was 12, and have used a huge array of languages ranging from the Fortran and lisp, to Kotlin and Dart. My current interests currently lie in Android development, data-science, and Artificial Intelligence/Neural Networks. I also have a passion for mathematics and love to research the theoretical side of computing.</p>

### Current Projects :hammer_and_wrench:

<p align="left"><b>Catscript</b> an original object oriented language whose compliler is written in Java.<br><br> In addition to this, I am activitely building and developing a robotic buggie powered by a raspberry pi and driven by Opencv. This robitic buggie will be driven by an android application leveraging Kotlin's server sockets.<br><br> My final, now completed project is an implementation of python's NEAT neural network library to solve simple games such as flappy bird. I will hopefully be crushing the classic game, Snake, with deeplearning soon. </p>
